# Cricket_Winner_Prediction_Model
This model tells us the most probable team winning the match based on 3 input i.e. team1, team2 and toss winner and also the model uses RandomForestClassifier.
Feel free to make any changes to the files if it makes more powerful model.

First few lines are EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to explore the data and clean the data.
Then we build the model first we try on Logistic Regression but the accuracy is low so we go with Random Forest Classifier.

The dataset used here are takesn from kaggle and is a little bit old and contains teams that now dont play.

Here is the link to Datalore file where you can see the things happening in the code
